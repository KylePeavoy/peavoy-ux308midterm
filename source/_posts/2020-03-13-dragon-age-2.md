Next on the list is Dragon Age 2. The "Rushed" game of the series as some fans like to put it. I do agree that a lot of the game seemed rushed, however it is still a solid addition to the series and I stand by that. In terms of the art style and where the company went with it. It is clear to see they were trying to define their own digital art style that relied heavily on symbols. It was as if Bioware took their original style and made everything pointy. A lot of the game was less detailed than before but I am going to chalk it up to the fact that the game was released so quickly after the first one. This game in the series is a small glimpse into what the series would become. At this time a lot of the series extra content, such as books and comics showcased the style the studio was trying for, it just felt a little unfinished when it came to this game.
