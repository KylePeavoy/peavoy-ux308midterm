Lastly in the series is the most recent game, Dragon Age Inquisition. This game is the defining game when it comes to Dragon Ages developed art style. At this point, Bioware was fully owned by EA and because of this, were forced to use their game engine, which is not optimized for RPGs. Even with this set back, the digital art in the game is breathtaking and crisp. It takes the best elements from 2 and adds the detail they deserve. No more is the style a generic RPG looking game like Origins, and gone is the overly symbolized pointy style of the second. The developers found a great mix that follows closely with their other media. For the future I would guess that Bioware is going to continue on the path they are on, not stray too far from what they have, just constantly adding more realism to each detail.
