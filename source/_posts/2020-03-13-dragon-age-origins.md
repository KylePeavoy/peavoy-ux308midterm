The first game to kick off the series was Dragon Age Origins. This was game was iconic for the company behind the series, Bioware. As it marked many milestones for them and was first in what would be one of the biggest game series ever. Released in 2009 for the XBOX 360 and PS3, this game followed the old art styles of classic RPGs, somewhat blocky but still (in my opinion) the best for setting the scene and letting the player fully immerse themselves into the world. This game was released before Bioware was acquired by EA so it has a lot more personal style to it as the studio had a lot more freedom. With the main focus on the story, the game left its mark but not for the artistry... yet!
