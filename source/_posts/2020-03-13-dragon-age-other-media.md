One thing that has never really changed throughout Dragon Ages entire lifespan has been its extra media outside the game. The series has, books, comics, web series and an anime movie. Where the games have differed in their styling, all other media has stayed true to what the series is becoming. The series style relies heavily on symbols and dark colours, favouring black and red. It is very fantasy looking and has its own flair that not many games could pull off. I have loved this series since the very beginning and I think the amount of work that goes into the art deserves to be talked about and recognized. I can't wait to see where this series goes.
